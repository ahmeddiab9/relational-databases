Numeric,"FLOAT(size, d)","A floating point number. The total number of digits is specified in size. The number of digits after the decimal point is specified in the d parameter. This syntax is deprecated in MySQL 8.0.17, and it will be removed in future MySQL versions"
Numeric,FLOAT(p),"A floating point number. MySQL uses the p value to determine whether to use FLOAT or DOUBLE for the resulting data type. If p is from 0 to 24, the data type becomes FLOAT(). If p is from 25 to 53, the data type becomes DOUBLE()"
Numeric,"DOUBLE(size, d)",A normal-size floating point number. The total number of digits is specified in size. The number of digits after the decimal point is specified in the d parameter
Numeric,"DOUBLE PRECISION(size, d)",Â 
Numeric,"DECIMAL(size, d)",An exact fixed-point number. The total number of digits is specified in size. The number of digits after the decimal point is specified in the d parameter. The maximum number for size is 65. The maximum number for d is 30. The default value for size is 10. The default value for d is 0.
Numeric,"DEC(size, d)","Equal to DECIMAL(size,d)"
